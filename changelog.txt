Update to 1.18.2

0.6.1:
Fixes
- Fix crash when loading block entities for Flywheel to render, most common when exploring the end.
- Fix occasional visual artifacts when enabling optifine shaders.
Technical/API
- Added more debug information to the F3 screen.
- Distance update limiting can now be disabled.

0.6.0:
With this release, Flywheel is no longer needed on servers! Forge finally has client commands,
and the /flywheel command now takes advantage of this.
Fixes
 - Fix crash when running with sodium/magnesium.
Technical/API
 - Backend is now a static class.
 - Shaders are now compiled on-the-fly and cached.
 - Significantly reduced the amount of boilerplate needed in instancing shaders.
 - Struct types no longer need to be registered ahead of time.
 - Simplify unnecessarily complicated game state system.

0.5.1:
Fixes
 - Fix crash on resource reload with backend off
 - Fix artifacts while using Optifine shaders
 - Fix crash when trying to access biomes in a VirtualRenderWorld
Technical/API
 - Refactor instance renderer registration to separate client and server logic (thanks Pepper!)
 - VirtualRenderWorlds now have a "biomeOffset" field which gets added when looking up biomes
 - Added GlStateTracker which hooks into GlStateManager to track changes in buffer, vertex array, and program bindings

0.5.0a:
Fixes
 - Address crash experienced by some users while rendering any tile.
 - Fix crash caused by loading a world with flywheel backend off.

0.5.0:
New
 - Added parallel batching backend, effectively a CPU instancer.
 - Now partially compatible with starlight.
Technical/API
 - Much more flexible vertex formats.
 - Do instance updates/ticking entirely async.

Fixes
 - Partially fix crash on intel and mesa drivers (needs Create to update)
 - Fix garbage rendering on AMD GPUs

 - Fixes weird delay in object appearance when reloading chunks
 - Add instances when chunks are built for rendering
 - Server worlds are not flywheel worlds
