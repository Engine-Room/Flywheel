0.2.3:
Technical/API:
 - Alter BeginFrameEvent to enable compatibility with optifine shadows

0.2.2:
Fixes
 - Fix ConcurrentModificationException crash
 - Fix NullPointer rendering create contraptions on older graphics cards
 - Fix crash triggered when moving large distances in a single frame

0.2.1:
Fixes
 - Potential fix for many issues caused by optimized chunk accesses
New
 - Added config+command to disable chunk access optimization

0.2.0:
New
 - Flywheel driven shulker box rendering
 - Optimize chunk accesses by caching previous result
 - Further optimize flywheel rendered objects through parallel updates
Changes
 - Distant objects are update throttled according to the sequence of prime numbers, smoothing out updates
 - Rename normalOverlay to debugNormals, make naming consistent across command and config
Fixes
 - Fix issue causing modded banner patterns to all have missing textures
Technical/API
 - Reorganize, simplify, and document everything in the MaterialManager tree
 - MaterialManagers associate RenderStates with MaterialGroups
 - Proper support for rendering in different layers (SOLID, CUTOUT, and TRANSPARENT)
 - New methods in MaterialManager to accommodate these changes
 - Deprecate old functions in MaterialManager in favor of new ones using MaterialGroups
 - InstanceDatas can be transferred to other Instancers via "instance stealing"
 - Abstraction for models, IModel
    - Easier to use, and gives Flywheel more freedom to optimize
    - Buffered models directly consume IModels
    - Added BlockModel, renders a single block
    - Added WorldModel, renders many blocks given a world instance
 - Cuboids can be inverted across Y and Z, used by many vanilla models for some reason
 - TransformStack scaling
 - VecBuffer coloring
 - Add more information to RenderLayerEvent and BeginFrameEvent

0.1.1:
New
 - Flywheel driven chest and bell rendering, ~20x performance improvement in contrived cases
Fixes
 - Fix crash rendering breaking overlay after reloading resource packs
Technical/API
 - Deprecate instance registration functions in favor of builders
 - Refactor breaking overlay renderer to be cleaner and more contained
 - Move per-world material managers out of WorldContext into InstancedRenderDispatcher
 - Add helper for getting information about texture atlases
 - Add more debug information for shader loading
 - Delete shaders after they're linked to programs

0.1.0:
Fixes
 - Render layer events are always dispatched, even when the backend is disabled
 - Fix a crash when light updates occur close to the world height
 - Fix issue with optifine shaders
 - Fix PartialModels not being initialized

0.0.3:
New
 - Include the logo in the mod
 - Prevent Minecraft from nuking the depth buffer on fabulous graphics
 - Add some more debug information when shader compilation fails
Fixes
 - Fix startup crash with intel drivers
 - Fix startup crash with optifine
 - Fix crash on server start
 - Fix "unknown custom packet identifier" errors
 - Fix crash on resource reload

0.0.2:
New
 - Added /flywheel backend command to replace /create experimentalRendering
 - Added /flywheel normalOverlay command
 - Added basic config
 - New logo (thanks, bumble_dani!)

0.0.1:
 - Initial release
